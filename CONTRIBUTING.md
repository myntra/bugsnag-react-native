## Building

bugsnag-react-native depends on
[bugsnag-android](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-android) and
[bugsnag-cocoa](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa) as well as React
Native itself for the headers and macros used in linking a native extension.
Because of these dependencies, it is easiest to hack on the library as a part of
an example project where all of these components are integrated.

## Testing

Unit tests for the JavaScript client are run with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/).

```sh
npm i
npm run test:unit:js
```

Code coverage is reported in the `./coverage` directory. On a Mac, the following command
will open the coverage report in your default browser:

```sh
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

## Running the examples app

Run `npm install`, then use `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`
to run the example projects.

## Releasing

### Upgrading the vendored libraries

To upgrade bugsnag-cocoa, prepare an updated version of bugsnag-cocoa, then copy
the Source and iOS directories. Assuming bugsnag-cocoa is located in the same
directory as bugsnag-react-native:

```
make ANDROID_VERSION=X IOS_VERSION=X upgrade_vendor
```

### Release Checklist
Please follow the testing instructions in [the platforms release checklist](https://github.com/bugsnag/platforms-release-checklist/blob/master/README.md), and any additional steps directly below.

* Ensure the example app sends the correct error for each type on iOS and
  Android
* Archive the iOS app and validate the bundle
* Generate a signed APK for Android

### Making a new release
1. Update the changelog with new features and fixes
2. `make VERSION=[number] release`
3. Create a new release on GitHub, copying the changelog entry.
